# Background

## Research Question
Can correcting be used as a friendship cue within children? 

## Study Design 
Between-Subjects Design 

**Predictors:**
1. Reported Age in Years: 4 to 13

2. Public vs. Private Selections: 0=public-1=private
  + Categorical
  
3. Correcting vs. Affirmation:1=affirming, 2=correcting
  + Categorical 
  
**Outcome:**
1. Friend Choice: Jayden or Taylor

## Predicted Results 
We predict that children would think the main character is better friends with the character corrected in private, and better friends with the person affirmed in public. 

# Data Preparation 

## Load Data 
```{r recode}
data<-read.csv("IMS3.3 (Pre-Reg) Data - Sheet1.csv")


```
## Rename Variables 
```{r RV}
colnames(data)[6]<-"condition"

colnames(data)[8]<-"corrected_in_public"

colnames(data)[9]<-"corrected_in_private"

colnames(data)[17]<-"friendship_choice"

colnames(data)[23]<-"age"

data<-subset(data,data$condition %in% c("R","W"))
```
## Data Processing 
```{r DP}
data$choice<-as.factor(ifelse(data$friendship_choice==data$corrected_in_public, 1,0))

# Output Linear Regression 

choiceIMS3.3<-glm(choice~condition,
                  data=data, family="binomial")

summary(choiceIMS3.3)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
